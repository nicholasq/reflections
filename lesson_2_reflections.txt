What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The init builds the git files needed to save snapshots. You need to do it so new commits
can be saved into these files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?

The staging area lets me pick which files will go into a commit. This way I can break up my commits
however I want. If I think a group of files should go into one commit and another group go into
another commit then I can do that.
