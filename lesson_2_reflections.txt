What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The init builds the git files needed to save snapshots. You need to do it so new commits
can be saved into these files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?

The staging area lets me pick which files will go into a commit. This way I can break up my commits
however I want. If I think a group of files should go into one commit and another group go into
another commit then I can do that.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can diff the working directory with staging area to see the changes made compared to
the latest commit. I can then add the files I want to the staging area and diff the 
staging area to the latest commit. This allows me to see and plan exactly which files
I want to include in my next commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How
would branches help?

Having different branches would enable me to organize very specific changes to their own history
(branch). This way I could add an experimental bug fix or experimental feature. I could also
have different versions of my project.

How do diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I am able to see the root commit of each branch and how they relate to each other branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram
the way we do?

The changes from the merged branch will be added to the 'primary' branch. It is represented 
in the diagram in a way that shows commits only know about their parent commits.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs always doing merges manually?

The pros are much less work on you to have to go through a add or delete lines of code.
The cons are that it may merge things in a way that you did not want or expect.
